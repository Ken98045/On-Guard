# On-Guard uses Blue Iris as a security camera source and DeepStack as an AI to intellegently identify objects.  
It allows the user to monitor as many cameras as desired.  It allows the user to visually create multiple areas 
that are of security interest, including the types of objects that are of interest in each area.  
It optionally triggers recording via Blue Iris and/or sends notification emails to the user.

Please refer to the file OnGuard-ReadMe.docx located in the docs folder for setup and use instructions.
