# On-Guard uses Blue Iris as a security camera source and DeepStack as an AI to intellegently identify objects.  
It allows the user to monitor as many cameras as desired.  It allows the user to visually create multiple areas 
that are of security interest, including the types of objects that are of interest in each area.  
It optionally triggers recording via Blue Iris and/or sends notification emails to the user.

Please refer to the file OnGuard-ReadMe.docx for setup and use instructions.

NOTE: I BELIEVE that all setup issues have now been resolved.  Also note that your anti-virus software
and/or Windows Defender may/will gripe about installing the application.  This is expected.
You should be able to click around any warnings that occur.
